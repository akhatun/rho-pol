Description of the folders---------
binnedData:
    it contains the file with the data in the format used by the macro that performs
    the mass fits that is systematics_weighted.c
    * 1phi_1pt.root contains the integrated data sample
    * 15phi_1pt.root contains the data sample binned in 15 ranges of a variable phi (for more info 
    look at one of my two talks at the UPCs meeting)
    * hWeights.root contains an histogram used to re-weight the MC to take into
    account differences in the pt spectra of data and MC

libraries
    it contains some .h file needed to read the imput files and to save the results

-----------------

systematics_weighted.c
it is the macro used to fit the mass distribution(s) -> in this macro it is not implemented the contribution from the omega
Once compiled run it using massFitInBin()
    the function can take 3 argument: the first is a string that does selection on neutrons
        "noSelection" -> if you do not want to look at the neutrons emitted
        "0n0n" -> no neutrons on both side of the IP
        "Xn0n" -> neutron(s) only at one side of the IP
        "XnXn" -> neutron(s) at both side of the IP
    the second argument is the number of phi bins, with the file attached this number could be 1 (to use 1phi_1pt.root) or 15 (to use 15phi_1pt.root)
    the third argument is the number of pt bins and needs to be 1

    massFitWithOmega.c
    this macro is similar to systematics_weighted.c and works in the same way, but the fit function include also the contribution from
    the omega. Unfortunately I am changing the architectury of the macro used to fit and this macro is not working at the moment, but it worked
    so you can copy the fit function
